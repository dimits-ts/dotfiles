This guidebook provides step-by-step instructions on creating synthetic discussions, annotations, and experiments.\n\n## How to Create a Synthetic Discussion\n![GitHub Actions Code](https://github Actions) 🚀\n\nFollow these steps to set up your first synthetic discussion:\n\n1. [Step 1: Set Up Your Environment](#step-1:-set-up-your-environment)\n   - Install the required packages using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install synthetic-discussions[base]\n     ```\n   - Clone this repository and your project's dependencies.\n\n2. [Step 2: Define Your Models](#step-2:-define-your-models)\n   - Create actors or integrate existing models.\n   - Ensure models are compatible with the framework's requirements.\n\n3. [Step 3: Configure Turn-Taking Strategies](#step-3:-configure-turn-taking-strategies)\n   - Implement basic or advanced turn-taking rules for your discussion structure.\n\n4. [Step 4: Run Your Discussion](#step-4:-run-your-discussion)\n   - Use the framework to simulate interactions between defined actors.\n\n5. [Step 5: Analyze Results](#step-5:-analyze-results)\n   - Evaluate outcomes using built-in metrics or export data for further analysis.\n\n## How to Annotate Your Synthetic Discussions\n![GitHub Actions Code](https://github Actions) 💬\n\nValidating and annotating synthetic discussions ensures quality control. Follow these steps:\n\n1. [Step 1: Load Your Discussion Dataset](#step-1:-load-your-discussion-dataset)\n   - Import your pre-generated discussion dataset.\n\n2. [Step 2: Initialize Annotators](#step-2:-initialize-annotators)\n   - Create instances of your annotation classes for different roles (e.g., moderator, participant).\n\n3. [Step 3: Perform Annotated Reviews](#step-3:-perform-annotated-reviews)\n   - Use the annotators to review and validate discussion interactions.\n\n4. [Step 4: Save Your Annotations](#step-4:-save-your-annotations)\n   - Export annotated data for analysis or further use in your project.\n\n## How to Use the Experiment API\n![GitHub Actions Code](https://github Actions) 🔄\n\nManage large-scale studies with synthetic discussions using our experiment API. This guide covers:\n\n1. [Step 1: Setting Up Experiments](#step-1:-setting-up-experiments)\n   - Create experiments with unique identifiers and configurations.\n\n2. [Step 2: Configuring Logging and Exporting](#step-2:-configuringLogging-and-Exporting)\n   - Set up logging for real-time data tracking.\n   - Configure export settings to generate synthetic datasets in CSV format.\n\n3. [Step 3: Running Experiments](#step-3:-running-experiments)\n   - Use the experiment API to manage multiple discussions and track their outcomes.\n\n4. [Step 4: Analyzing Experimental Results](#step-4:-analyzing-experimental-results)\n   - Extract insights from experimental data using our provided analytics tools.\n\n5. [Step 5: Documenting Experiments](#step-5:-documenting-experiments)\n   - Create detailed documentation for reproducibility and future reference.\n\nThese guides are your comprehensive resource for working with synthetic discussions in the framework. Happy experimenting!"

The current setup has three markdown files inside a directory called \"guides\" with .ipynb extensions, which are Jupyter Notebooks. But they want this documentation to be clear and easy for new users to understand.\n\nFirst, I should consider the structure of the guides.md file. Right now, it's just listing the three guides without any headings or bullet points. To make it more user-friendly online, each guide should have its own section with clear headings. Using markdown headers like #, ##, and ### can help organize this information effectively.\n\nI notice that in the original response, the user used \"## How to Create a Synthetic Discussion\" as the first heading. That's good because it immediately tells the reader what the section is about. I should replicate this structure for each guide: main title with a primary header, a subheader explaining what the section covers, and then some content.\n\nNext, adding bullet points will make the steps easy to follow. For example, under \"How to Create a Synthetic Discussion,\" I can list actions like setting up models, actors, and strategies. Using icons (like GitHub's code emoji) can draw attention without being too distracting.\n\nI also want to include a brief description for each guide so that readers know what to expect before diving in.

Since the guides are currently in .ipynb files, translating them into clear text explanations will make the documentation more accessible online.\n\nI should also think about adding some general tips or best practices at the end of each section to reinforce key points and help users apply what they've learned effectively.\n\nFinally, organizing everything with clear headings and concise language will make the guides more readable.
