The researcher can determine how these participants behave, whether there is a moderator present and even how the turn-taking is determined.\n#### Synthetic Annotation Generation with multiple annotators\nThe researcher can create multiple LLM annotator-agent profiles. Each of these annotators will process each generated discussion at the comment-level, and annotate according to the provided instruction prompt, enabling an arbitrary selection of metrics to be used.\n#### Native Transformers support\nThe framework supports most Hugging Face Transformer models out-of-the-box. Support for models managed by other libraries can be easily achieved by extending a single class.\n#### Native logging and fault tolerance\nSince SynDisco is expected to possibly run for days at a time in remote servers, it keeps detailed logs both on-screen and on-disk.

The researcher can determine how these participants behave, whether there is a moderator present and even how the turn-taking is determined.\n\n- **Synthetic Group Discussion Generation**  \n  SynDisco accepts an unlimited number of LLM user-agent profiles and possible Original Posts (OPs). Each experiment involves randomly selecting these user-agents to reply to a randomly selected OP. Researchers can determine participant behavior, whether there's a moderator, and how turn-taking is handled.\n# Synthetic Annotation Generation with Multiple Annotators  \nThe researcher can create multiple LLM annotator-agent profiles. Each of these annotators will process each generated discussion at the comment-level, and annotate according to the provided instruction prompt, enabling an arbitrary selection of metrics to be used.\n\n- **Synthetic Annotation Generation with Multiple Annotators**  \n  Researchers create multiple LLM annotator profiles. Each annotator processes generated discussions at the comment level and annotates according to predefined instruction prompts. This allows for the selection of various metrics.\n# Native Transformers Support  \nThe framework supports most Hugging Face Transformer models out-of-the-box. Users can easily extend support for other libraries by extending a single class.\n\n- **Native Transformers Support**  \n  The framework supports most Hugging Face Transformer models out-of-the-box.

Should any experiment fail, the next one will be loaded with no intermittent delays. Results are intermittently saved to the disk, ensuring no data loss or corruption even in case of catastrophic errors.\n\n- **Native Logging and Fault Tolerance**  \n  SynDisco runs remotely and keeps detailed logs both on-screen and on-disk.
