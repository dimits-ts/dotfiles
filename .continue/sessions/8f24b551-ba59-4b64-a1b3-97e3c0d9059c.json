With only a handful of configurations, the researcher can run hundreds or thousands of unique experiments.\n#### Synthetic Group Discussion Generation\nSynDisco accepts an arbitrarily large number of LLM user-agent profiles and possible Original Posts (OPs). Each experiment involves a random selection of these user-agents replying to a randomly selected OP. The researcher can determine how these participants behave, whether there is a moderator present and even how the turn-taking is determined.\n#### Synthetic Annotation Generation with multiple annotators\nThe researcher can create multiple LLM annotator-agent profiles. Each of these annotators will process each generated discussion at the comment-level, and annotate according to the provided instruction prompt, enabling an arbitrary selection of metrics to be used.\n#### Native Transformers support\nThe framework supports most Hugging Face Transformer models out-of-the-box. Support for models managed by other libraries can be easily achieved by extending a single class.\n#### Native logging and fault tolerance\nSince SynDisco is expected to possibly run for days at a time in remote servers, it keeps detailed logs both on-screen and on-disk. Should any experiment fail, the next one will be loaded with no intermittent delays. Results are intermittently saved to the disk, ensuring no data loss or corruption on even catastrophic errors."

        "text": "\nOkay, so I need to help convert a subsection into a list without changing anything else except formatting it as a bulleted list in markdown. The user provided some specific instructions and an example response. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the original content is under the header \"Features\" with several subfeatures listed as \"####\" headers. The task is to turn each of these into bullet points starting with a bolded title followed by the explainer text. Also, I should make sure that when pasted into markdown source, it's correctly formatted so the user can copy it.\n\nLooking at the example response provided, each feature becomes an unordered list item where the first line is the title in bold and the subsequent lines are the explanations. Each bullet starts with a hyphen followed by some spacing to indicate continuation of thought or emphasis.\n\nSo, I'll take each subfeature from the original content:\n\n1. Automated Experiment Generation\n2. Synthetic Group Discussion Generation\n3. Synthetic Annotation Generation with multiple annotators\n4. Native Transformers support\n5. Native Logging and fault tolerance\n\nEach of these will become a bullet point in markdown, starting with the title in bold. The rest of each line is the explanation after an appropriate number of spaces to show it's part of the list item.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm using the correct markdown syntax for unordered lists—each bullet starts with `- ` and then some spacing (like three spaces) before the text. Also, making sure that each title is bolded by surrounding it with double asterisks.\n\nWait, in the example response, sometimes there's a line break between the first part of the explanation and the continued points. So maybe I should structure each bullet point as:\n\n- **Title**\n  - Further explanation or details\n\nBut looking back at the user's example, they just have one level of bullets without sub-bullets. So perhaps it's better to keep it simple with just the main title followed by the text.\n\nSo for each feature, it would be:\n\n- **Automated Experiment Generation**  \n  With only a few configurations, run many experiments easily.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI should check that all the original content is preserved correctly without any changes in meaning or structure. The user emphasized not altering anything else except the formatting into bullet points.\n\nAlso, ensuring consistency in capitalization and punctuation as per markdown syntax.\n\nSo putting it all together, each feature becomes a bullet point with the title in bold followed by its explanation.\n",
