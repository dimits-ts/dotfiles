The researcher can determine how these participants behave, whether there is a moderator present and even how the turn-taking is determined.\n#### Synthetic Annotation Generation with multiple annotators\nThe researcher can create multiple LLM annotator-agent profiles. Each of these annotators will process each generated discussion at the comment-level, and annotate according to the provided instruction prompt, enabling an arbitrary selection of metrics to be used.\n#### Native Transformers support\nThe framework supports most Hugging Face Transformer models out-of-the-box.

The original text is about features of SynDisco, and each feature has some detailed explanations. The user wants this turned into a list where each entry starts with the title in bold and then the explainer text following it.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the original content to understand each point. There are five main features: Automated Experiment Generation, Synthetic Group Discussion Generation, Synthetic Annotation Generation with multiple annotators, Native Transformers support, and Native Logging and Fault Tolerance.\n\nEach of these is a subsection under \"Features.\" My task is to transform this into bullet points where the title is bolded. The important thing is not to change the content—just structure it as a list.\n\nI should start each point with an asterisk (*) followed by a space for Markdown bullets. Then, I'll bold the title using double asterisks. After that, I'll include the original text but without any markdown since the user specified that the final answer should be in source code mode for copying.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the example response provided, it looks like each list item starts with \"####\" which is four hyphens followed by a space. But then again, in Markdown, sometimes people use double asterisks for bolding titles in lists. I'm a bit confused now—what's the correct structure here?\n\nLooking at the user's example response, they used \"#### Automated Experiment Generation\" with some text after. So perhaps each list item is indented and starts with four hyphens or something similar. But since the user specified that the answer should be in source code mode, I think using the bullet points correctly is essential.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use a more standard Markdown list structure where each point starts with an asterisk followed by space, then bold the title part. Let me check: In the example response provided by the user, they used \"####\" for the headers but didn't follow that convention here because the first line is the overall heading.\n\nWait, in their answer, each feature is indented under a larger list item with four hyphens. For example:\n\n```\n## Features\n#### Automated Experiment Generation\n\n```\n\nBut since I need to create markdown code blocks in source code mode, maybe I should represent it as such. However, when pasting into a Markdown document, indentation matters for the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use each list item starting with four hyphens and then bolding the title part. But no, that might not be necessary because in some Markdown formats, the title can be bolded separately from the bullet points.\n\nBut I think the user's example response shows that they want the titles in bold regardless of indentation. So perhaps each list item is indented with four spaces or hyphens and then the title is bolded using double asterisks.\n\nI'm getting a bit tangled here, but maybe it's easier to just structure each feature as a bullet point starting with an asterisk, followed by some indentation, then bolding the title part. Alternatively, if I follow the user's example response, perhaps each list item starts with \"####\" and then the title is in bold.\n\nBut looking at their answer, they had:\n\n```\n## Features\n#### Automated Experiment Generation\n\n*SynDisco generates a randomized set of discussion templates...\n```\n\nSo that's not exactly bullet points but more like subheadings. Wait, no—it seems like each feature starts with \"####\" and then the title is in bold.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The user wants each feature as a list item where the title is bolded. So in Markdown, typically that would be done by starting the line with double asterisks before the text to make it bold, but if it's part of a larger bullet point structure, maybe it's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to have each feature listed as a separate line with \"####\" and then the title in bold. But since they want the list starting with the title bolded, I think using double asterisks before each title would suffice.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the user's example response, they wrote:\n\n```\n## Features\n#### Automated Experiment Generation\n\n*SynDisco generates a randomized set of discussion templates...\n```\n\nHmm, that seems to mix list items with subheadings. Maybe in their context, using \"####\" as a marker is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each feature should be its own bullet point starting with an asterisk and then the title in bold on the same line.\n\nBut I think the user expects each feature to start with \"####\" followed by the bolded title, which would resemble subheadings. So I'll follow that structure as per their example response.\n\nSo putting it all together, for each feature:\n\n- Start with \"####\"\n- Then write a space\n- Then the bolded title (using double asterisks)\n- Then continue with the explanation\n\nBut wait, in Markdown, if you have multiple levels of headings, they are separated by two or more spaces. So perhaps each feature is its own subheading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use bullet points starting with an asterisk and then bold the title on the same line.\n\nI think I'll proceed with using \"####\" followed by a space and then the bolded title for each feature, as per the user's example.
