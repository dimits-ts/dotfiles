They also mentioned that I should include the language and filename in any code blocks I provide. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what information is necessary for their documentation. The project structure usually includes directories like src, models, utils, etc., along with key files such as __init__.py in each directory.\n\nI'll start by outlining the main directory structure under src. Then, list the important modules and their purposes. For example, constants.py holds environment variables, data.py defines datasets, models.py has model classes, training.py includes functions for model initialization, etc.\n\nNext, I should identify the main classes that are central to the project's functionality. The Model class would be essential, handling the actual machine learning tasks. Other important classes might include HyperparameterTuner for optimization and DatasetLoader for data management.\n\nI'll make sure each part is concise since the user requested a short explanation. Using bullet points will help in readability within a markdown format.\n\nFinally, I need to ensure that any code blocks are properly formatted with the language specified (Python) and filename as per the example given. Although in this case, it's more of an explanation than actual code, but if needed, the structure can be applied to code snippets.\n",
